TextMUD
=======

A text mud created with the BYOND Engine.

Upon branching from this source, adding races, classes, abilities, and even skills
are genuinely easy to do. To do so, just simply goto the _Main.dm file in either
the Classes Folder, Races Folder, Abilities Folder, or Stats Folder, and simply
follow that same format when creating a new addition. Just make sure to follow this exact
format.
